This course is meant to teach JavaScript as a programming language, we will not look at using it with web development. I would still strongly urge you to go through this course first, but if you are looking for JavaScript with web development then go through my course

The first key concept of any programming language is variables. Variables allow us to store data for later use and modification. The first form of data we can use a variable to store is a string. A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks ('' or ""), the following are example of strings

<code><js><filename>

<code>

; or not
var, let, const (stick with let over var, keeps local)
all basic variable types
