When creating layouts on our website it very common to want to align/distribute items - be it vertically or horizontally. Flexbox allows us to do this with ease using align-items and justify-content.

<br>
<br>

A very important part of flexbox is the way in which items are laid out. There are 2 axis that are called row and column. We can tell a flex container how to layout its flex items using these axis: justify-content for the row axis and align-items for the column axis. We will start with this code

<code><css>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./Index.css">
    </head>

    <body>
        <div>
            <p class="paragraph_1">1</p>
            <p class="paragraph_2">2</p>
            <p class="paragraph_3">3</p>
            <p class="paragraph_4">4</p>
            <p class="paragraph_5">5</p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
<code>

<code><css>
div {
    width: 500px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    display: flex;
}

p {
    border: 1px solid red;
    flex-basis: 50px;
}
<code>

So, we can use justify-content to distribute flex items across the row axis, where it can take a few values. This property justify-content is given to the flex container (our div). Let's add a justify-content of center to our flex container

<code><css>
div {
    width: 500px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
}
<code>

This will cause all of our flex items to be centered in the container. The other values justify-content can take are: flex-start, flex-end, baseline, space-between, space-around and space-evenly. Either play around with these values or go

<br>
<br>

Similar to align-content, align-items tells the flex container how to distribute its flex items on the column axis. Right now our div is only taking up the height necessary so using align-items wouldn't actually change anything. Lets add a height of 300px to our div and a align-items of flex-end

<code><css>
div {
    width: 500px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: flex-end;
    height: 300px;
}
<code>

You will see that all the flex items are now pushed to the bottom of the div, this is also working with the justify-content which is making them centered along the row axis.

Thats it for part 3. Thanks for reading!
