Flexbox is a css layout module that makes it easy to distribute items evenly and create a fluid layout. We will first start by creating a html file with a div. Inside of this div we will place 5 paragraphs inside, each with a class of 1 through 5. We will also link a css file to this html file in head

<code><html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./Index.css">
    </head>

    <body>
        <div>
            <p class="paragraph_1">1</p>
            <p class="paragraph_2">2</p>
            <p class="paragraph_3">3</p>
            <p class="paragraph_4">4</p>
            <p class="paragraph_5">5</p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
<code>

Inside this css file give the div a property display with value flex

<code><css>
div {
    display: flex;
}
<code>

I you view this page now on your browser (by dragging and dropping the html file) you will notice that each of the paragraphs sit on the same line, directly one after another. If we were to remove the display of flex the paragraphs would each go onto a new line - kind of like a list. By giving the div a display of flex we are making become what is called a flex container. Every item that is inside a flex container becomes a flex item. This allows us to modify both the flex container and the flex items separately.

One way we can modify each flex item is with the order property. By default this property is 0. We will give the 3rd paragraph an order of 1 and see what happens

<code><css>
.paragraph_3 {
    order: 1;
}
<code>

Doing this causes the 3rd paragraph to get moved to the end. This is because by default all of the other paragraphs have an order of 0. Lets give the 1st paragraph an order of 2

<code><css>
.paragraph_1 {
    order: 2;
}
<code>

You will see that the 1st paragraph gets pushed to the end. What would happen if we gave the 1st paragraph an order of 1 as well? Would the 3rd come before or after the 1st? You can check for yourself if you wish, but the 1st will come first. This is because in our html the paragraph_1 comes first. So when flex items have the same order, it goes off of their original order in the html.

Thats it for this first part. Thanks for watching!
