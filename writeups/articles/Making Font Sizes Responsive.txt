When making websites a very common problem a lot of developer face is font sizes. We want to make them look good on all screen sizes and devices, but how?

<br>

Many people use the unit em for setting a fonts size. An em sets the fonts size relative to it's parent - so giving one element a value of 2em might be totally different to giving another element somewhere else on our site the same value. So em's quickly become hard to handle and a nightmare to make every part of our site feel the same.

<br>

The value we want to use is rem. A rem is the same as an em but is relative to our html body. So giving elements a value of 2rem will always result in having the same size no matter where that element is on our website.

To start we are going give our html a font size. Now the value we are going to give the font size of the html is going to be in pixels because we want a hard coded value for our whole site to be relative to. I use a font size of 22px for desktop screen sizes - this value can be anything you want, you might prefer 20 or 24 its just preference.

<code><css>
html {
    font-size: 22px;
}
<code>

Then we are going to add our media queries to change this font size depending on our screen size. I use 3 breakpoints at 1200px, 768px and 480px for small desktops, tablets and phones. Use whatever suits you. In each of these we will lower the font size - again these values are preference but I will be using 20, 18 and 16 respectively.

<code><css>
html {
    font-size: 22px;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 1200px) { 
	html {
		font-size: 20px;
	}
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) { 
	html {
		font-size: 18px;
	}
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) { 
	html {
		font-size: 16px;
	}
}
<code>

Now throughout all development when we are giving elements a font size and we set it to 1rem we can guarantee that the value will be 22px (or the others depending on users screen size). So we will use this knowledge when styling any element. Want all normal text to be the same size? Simply give it a font size of 1rem. Want all headers ot be a certain size? Simply give them a value of 1.5rem (or whatever you choose) and they will always be the same size across all pages of your site.
